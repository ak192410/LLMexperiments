# Transformer Project

This repository contains code for implementing and training a transformer model for natural language processing tasks.

## Project Structure

- `transformer.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and training code
- `data/`: Directory containing training data
- `input.txt`: Sample input text for testing

## Setup

To run this project, you'll need Python with the following dependencies:
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Jupyter

## Usage

The main implementation is in the Jupyter notebook. To run it:

```bash
jupyter notebook transformer.ipynb
```

## Model Files

The trained model files (model.pkl and tokenizer.pkl) are not tracked in this repository due to their size. You can generate them by running the training code in the notebook.
